## Introduction

Ultramarathons are races longer than the traditional marathon distance of 42.195 kilometers (26.219 miles), typically ranging from 50 kilometers to several hundred kilometers. This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle to analyze and compare ultramarathon performance between men and women.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running?resource=download), comprising detailed information on ultramarathon events, participants, distances, and completion times.

## Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency.
- Analyze and compare the number of 50km and 50mi ultramarathon runs completed by men and women.
- Visualize the findings using graphs and charts for clear interpretation.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned and standardized the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Formatted data to facilitate accurate analysis and comparisons.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Calculated the total number of 50km and 50mi ultramarathon runs completed by men and women.
   - Analyzed and compared the distribution of race completions across different genders and distances.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Created visualizations using Python's Matplotlib or other suitable libraries to illustrate the analysis findings.
   - Developed graphs and charts to visualize the comparison between men and women in completing 50km and 50mi ultramarathons.

## Key Features

- **Gender-Based Analysis:** Compare race completions between men and women.
- **Distance Comparison:** Analyze the frequency of 50km and 50mi ultramarathon completions.
- **Graphical Representation:** Visualize data insights through graphs and charts for enhanced understanding.
