## Introduction

Cryptocurrencies have become a significant part of the financial ecosystem, and timely data is crucial for making informed decisions. This project automates the process of pulling data from a cryptocurrency website using its API. By automating data retrieval, users can maintain up-to-date datasets without manual intervention, enabling efficient data analysis and application development.

## Problem Statement

In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading and analysis, having access to the latest data is essential. Manual data collection is time-consuming, prone to errors, and not feasible for real-time applications. The need for an automated solution to retrieve and log cryptocurrency data is critical for traders, analysts, and developers who require up-to-date information to make informed decisions and drive application functionality.

## Features

- **Automated Data Retrieval:** Automatically fetch cryptocurrency data using API calls.
- **Customizable Scheduling:** Set up periodic data pulls using task schedulers.
- **Logging:** Save retrieved data into a file for later analysis.
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling to manage failed API requests.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- A computer with internet access.
- Python 3.6 or higher installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- An account on the cryptocurrency website with API access.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-data-pull.git
   cd crypto-data-pull
2.**Install Required Packages**
pip install requests

## Configuration
Generate API Key:

Go to the cryptocurrency website.
Sign in to your account and navigate to the API section.
Generate a new API key.
Set Up Configuration File:

Open the project directory.
Create a file named config.py.
Inside config.py, define the API key as follows:
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
