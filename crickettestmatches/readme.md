The data used in this analysis is sourced from [Cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org/), a platform offering detailed ball-by-ball data for international and T20 cricket matches, enabling robust statistical analysis.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw cricket test match data for consistency and accuracy.
- Analyze player career statistics, including determining the average career length.
- Calculate average batting strike rates during different time periods.
- Identify the maximum highest innings score achieved by each country in test matches.
- Visualize trends using graphs, specifically creating an average score graph by country.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Extracted raw data from Cricsheet and standardized its format.
   - Addressed missing or erroneous data points to ensure data integrity.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Calculated the average career length of cricketers based on available data.
   - Analyzed batting strike rates to understand scoring trends across different periods.
   - Determined the highest innings score achieved by each country.
   - Created visualizations using tools like Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn to depict average scores by country.

## Key Questions Addressed

1. **Average Career Length of Cricketers:**
   - Explored the duration of cricketers' careers to understand the typical length of time spent playing test matches.

2. **Average Batting Strike Rate:**
   - Examined batting strike rates to assess the scoring efficiency of batsmen over time.

3. **Maximum Highest Innings Score by Country:**
   - Identified the highest innings score achieved by each country in test matches, highlighting exceptional performances.

4. **Average Score by Country (Graph):**
   - Created graphical representations to compare and visualize average scores achieved by different countries in test matches.
