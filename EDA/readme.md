## Introduction

The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API provides access to a wealth of economic data, including unemployment rates across states in the United States. This project aims to retrieve, analyze, and visualize this data to gain insights into unemployment trends over time.

## Data Source

The data for this analysis is sourced directly from the [FRED API](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/), which offers a comprehensive collection of economic data, including unemployment rates by state.

## Objectives

- Pull unemployment rate data from the FRED API.
- Analyze and summarize unemployment trends across different states.
- Visualize unemployment trends in a single graph to compare state-level data effectively.

## Methodology

1. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Utilize the FRED API to fetch unemployment rate data for all states.
   - Extract relevant data points such as state, unemployment rate, and timestamp.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Calculate statistical metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation of unemployment rates.
   - Identify trends and patterns in unemployment rates across states.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Create a graph using Python's Matplotlib or other visualization libraries to display unemployment trends for all states in a single plot.
   - Enhance the graph with labels, titles, and annotations for clarity and understanding.

## Key Features

- **State-wise Unemployment Rates:** Display the latest unemployment rates by state.
- **Trend Analysis:** Visualize unemployment trends over a specified period for all states in a unified graph.
- **Interactive Graphs:** Provide interactive features such as hover-over details or zoom capabilities for enhanced data exploration.
